# Copy SellFlux

### This project was made to put into practice my knowledge in ReactJS and NextJS. I made a copy of the SellFlux site, as it had many elements that I could train. The technologies used to make this site were:

> #### React JS
> #### React Icons
> #### CSS-in-JS
> #### Styled Components

<br>
